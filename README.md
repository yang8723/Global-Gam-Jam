# Global-Game-Jam
2020 Global Game Jam with Carlos 

Theme = Repair 

The user interacts with three different buildings that produce money, labour or materials

Every once in awhile a natural disaster (e.g. tornado, fire) wil hit and decrease the rate at which the three buildings produce their specfic resources.

The probability you will get hit by the natural disaster is shown in the top right corner

Use the resources you have in the top left corner (Money, Labour and materials) to repair the buildings.

Interact with the buildings by pressing the up arrow key when you're in front of the building

To stop interacting, pressed the down arrow key

+5% or -5% Money, Labour or materials of your own resources to repair the buidlings 

You lose the game when you have less than 150% of the total resources of three buildings
