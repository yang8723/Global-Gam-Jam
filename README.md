# Global-Gam-Jam
2020 Global Game Jam with Carlos 

Theme = Repair 

The user interacts with three different buildings that represent; money, labour and resources 
Every once in awhile a natural disaster will hit and decrease the rate at which the three buildings produce their specific resources.
It is a survival game where the user has to decide which building to repair/destroy at a rate of +-5% to ensure that the world is still functional with enough resources.
